Code and Datasets of the Machine Learning assignments 

## Titles of assignments 

Assignment 1-
Using suitable dataset,Implementation of Linear Regression for predicting weight of a person when 
his height is known.


Assignment 2-
The dataset is a list of brain weight and body weight measurements from a bunch of animals in the 
form of tsv file. Create the linear regression model and perform the following:
1. Define dependent and independent variables
2. Find accuracy score
3. Convert train (80%) and Test (20%) data to test the accuracy.
4. Perform the prediction
5. Plot the linear model

Assignment 3-
Create the multiple regression model for the dataset of house. This will be used the predict the price 
of the home based on at least five factors. Decide the dependent and independent variables.
1. Find accuracy score
2. Convert train (80%) and Test (20%) data to test the accuracy.
3. Perform the prediction
4. Find mean squared error.
5. Print values of coefficients and intercept
6. Plot the linear model (at least four plots on single plane)

Assignment 4-
Using suitable dataset, predict whether a bank note is authentic or fake depending upon the different 
attributes of the image(such as Variance of wavelet transformed image, curtosis of the 
image,entropy, and skewness of the image.) of the note

Assignment 5-
Using suitable dataset Implementation of K-Means Clustering by Silhouette Method.

Assignment 6-
Using suitable dataset Implementation of K-Means Clustering by Elbow Method.
